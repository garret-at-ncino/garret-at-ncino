## Hi, I'm Garret — Senior Security Engineer @ nCino

I build automated security guardrails and policy guidance that empower developers to adopt secure practices without compromising velocity.

## What I Do

- Security Engineering & Automation — Custom GitHub Actions for policy enforcement across CI/CD, SAST rule development (Semgrep, Opengrep, Orca), and security workflow automation with n8n.
- Platform Administration — GitHub Enterprise and Sourcegraph administration, security baseline definition, and enforcement across development environments.
- Security Education — Monthly technical articles on OWASP Top 10 and emerging threats, translating security requirements into actionable developer guidance.
